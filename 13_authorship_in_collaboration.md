##Authorship in massive collaborative projects

**Goals for this lesson**

* understand the formal requirements for authorship in biomedical journals;
* compare and contrast these requirements with contributions to software and data;
* introduce the incentive structure behind authorship;

### Before class

Please read [this blog post](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-authorship-on-software-papers.html), and consider the following question:

What do you think is the appropriate set of requirements for authorship on a software paper? Is it:

1. I agree with the [ICMJE recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) - authors need to be involved in design/analysis of the research, AND the writing of the paper.
2. Any significant intellectual contribution to the software or research is sufficient.
3. Any significant contribution to the software is sufficient.
4. Any contribution to the software is sufficient for authorship.

Please decide on one, and then [read some of the comments](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-authorship-on-software-papers.html#comment-2420769424) on the blog post. At random, please pick 3 substantive comments that disagree with you, and record their URLs. Then fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gUGaJu_1RA5HNXB_XM8joGjBSJUk61bLUxyAPgm0dhY) before class.
