##Simple software in R continued (Loops)

**Goals for this lesson**

* Automate repetitive tasks in R

So, this has emerged more organically than I expected- out dataset has produced opportunities for us to work with functions, for loops and if-statements at an earlier point in our classroom work flow, so I will include some tutorials here, but really, this is now review! Cool! we're going to work on plotting in this class to determine what patterns exist in our data, what statistical tests we should do, and so on. Those fireflies won't know what's coming!
