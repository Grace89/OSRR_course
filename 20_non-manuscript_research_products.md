##Non-manuscript scientific products

**Goals for this lesson**

* Understand that more than publications are needed to further open science
* Hear about current efforts to highlight software (and other) contributions

Today, Abigail Cabunoc Mayes (Lead Developer, Mozilla Science Lab) will be looking at incentivizing open science at all steps in the research process with a focus on software contributions. We will look at some of the Mozilla Science Lab's work prototypying tools testing ways to bring open science into the scholarly workflow.

We may also try issuing badges to class participants.
