##Open Licensing: Creative Commons

**Goals for this lesson**

* Get an idea what licenses exist?
* What are pros/cons of different licenses
* When to use which licenses?

### Important Points
* Is it licence or license? Discuss (j/k)
* Open Licensing is a hack that works within regular copyright restrictions
* Different licenses exist
  * Does it apply Copyleft?
  * Does it allow commercial use?
  * Does it require people to attribute me as the source?
* Not one type of licenses fits all!
  * Code != Art/Writing != Data
  * Data Sharing needs very permissive licenses in order to be useful (e.g. CC0)
  * Excluding commercial use often leads to trouble (e.g. what's commercial?)
