**Goals for this lesson**

* Understand why open licenses are used
* Get an idea what licenses exist - and how those apply to data
* What are pros/cons of different licenses
* How open licenses affect collaboration and reuse
* Steps you can take

### Important Points
* Is it licence or license? Discuss (j/k)
* What does an Open License signal to users (and to you)
  * Shift from All Rights Reserved to Some Rights Reserved
* History of Open Licensing (Free/Libre/Open Source Licenses)
  * Free/Open Source Software
  * Creative Commons
  * Open Access Definition
* Open Licensing is a hack that works within regular copyright restrictions
* Different licenses exist
  * Does it apply Copyleft / "ShareAlike" provisions=?
  * Does it allow commercial use?
  * Does it require people to attribute me as the source?
  * Difference between Attribution and Citation
* Beyond copyright, what else do I need to think about?
  * International collaboration
  * When copyright doesn't apply
  * Database directives (Canada, EU, Australia, etc.)
* Future proofing your data
  * Interoperability
  * Maximizing use downstream
* Key takeaways / steps you can take
  * Not one type of licenses fits all!
    * Code != Art/Writing != Data
    * How to make your data as open and interoperable as possible
    * Understand the common fears, myths, concerns
    * Have a discussion with your collaborators
    * Make a clear license statement / reuse plan
