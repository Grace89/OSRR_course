##Visualization as an outreach tool

**Goals for this lesson**

* Talk about how to connect our science to the public

Today, we'll be chatting with Joey Lee, a Mozilla Fellow and MSc student (soon to be just MSc!) at the University of British Columbia. Joey spends a lot of time thinking about maps, visualization, and communicating meaning with data. He'll be telling us about a few of his projects.

**Resources:**

* [Aerial Bold: A Clever Typeface Crafted From Satellite Shots of Buildings](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/aerial-bold-clever-typeface-crafted-satellite-shots-buildings/) is one of Joey's projects.
