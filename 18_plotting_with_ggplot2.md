##Creating basic plots using ggplot2

**Goals for this lesson**

* How to plot simple things with ggplot2
  * scatterplots
  * bar charts
  * box/violin plot
  * density plots / histograms
* When should you use which graph technique?

Last, but not least: There's no simple way to make 3D pie charts with ggplot2.
And that's by design, because [3D pie charts are considered evil](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2011/07/death-to-pie-charts).
Actually even 2D pie charts are not so nice, so try other visualization techniques instead, i.e. bar charts.
*The only exception to this rule: delivering tasty 3D pie charts to your lecturers.*
