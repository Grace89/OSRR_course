##Simple software in R (Functions)

**Goals for this lesson**

* Impliment some simple functions in R
* Make life easier!

Software Carpentry has some [excellent lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html) on functions for R. However, our firefly dataset and related weather data has provided a useful, real world opportunity to develop functions that we can use towards our eventual publication. Cool! We're going to write a function that will take in our weather data, and provide a reasonable estimate for any missing data points, and spits back out the data set with no missing data, which would trip up our degree day model. The SWC lesson will be used as a reference- it is very useful for you to look at this in your own time.

**Resources:**

* [User defined functions](http://www.statmethods.net/management/userfunctions.html) from Quick R
